*Notes:*
- This documentation was automatically generated by Servant.
- Except for manual testing, you are not supposed to concern yourself with how the data is serialized; that's all glue code invisible to the developer under normal circumstances. `Elm.hs` generates Elm functions that automatically encode and decode data, and Servant generates Haskell encoders/parsers with TH-generated FromJSON and ToJSON instances.
